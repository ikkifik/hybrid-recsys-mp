This project was created for my last project to complete my degree.  
  
Long story short, this project was inspired by comment on facebook group that eventually questioned, "Is this things is good rather than that?"  or "could you give any recommendation?". Then I try to collect the data based on several keyword from marketplace in Indonesia.  

Here some big prerequisite to run this project:
- Python 3
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Flask
- nltk
- SQLAlchemy and Pymysql (idk, why i'm using this both)

Anyway, you can find rest of them inside requirements.txt file.
